                <p>We organize several fundraising events throughout the year</p>
                <p>
                  New meditation chairs are needed for the chapel. It will cost an estimated $183 per chair. That figure is for a minimum of 30 chairs. 26 are needed for the chapel; some devotees want to order one for home use. The total amount of money needed is $5,490; there is currently $1,335 in the chair fund, leaving $4,155 to be raised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you wish to make a donation to the chair fund, whether for a full chair or any amount, please make checks out to: Ann Arbor Meditation Circle, or to AAMC of SRF.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There will be envelopes on the table at the rear of the chapel labeled "Chair Fund", which can be used for cash or checks.
                  If you are making the donation for a personal chair for home use, please specify.
