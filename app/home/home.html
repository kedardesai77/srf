                Self-Realization Fellowship was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda for the purpose of disseminating Kriya Yoga, a definite scientific technique for attaining direct personal experience of God. Through its worldwide service and teachings, Self-Realization Fellowship seeks to awaken greater understanding of the harmony underlying all true religions, and a fuller expression in this world of the love that unites all people when they realize their oneness in God.
